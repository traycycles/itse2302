<h3 id="click1">Variable Names:</h3>
<p> At W3schools we use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions).<br/>
    All names start with a letter.
</p>


<h3 id="click2">Spaces Around Operators:</h3>
<p>
    Always put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ), and after commas:
</p>


<h3 id="click3">Code Indentation:</h3>
<p>
    Always use 4 spaces for indentation of code blocks:
</p>



<h3 id="click4">Statement Rules</h3>
<p>
    General rules for simple statements:
    <ul>
        <li>Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.</li></ul>
    General rules for complex (compound) statements:
    <ul>
        <li>Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.</li>
        <li>Use one space before the opening bracket.</li>
        <li>Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.</li>
        <li>Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h3 id="click5">Object Rules:</h3>
<p>
    General rules for object definitions:
    <ul>
        <li>Place the opening bracket on the same line as the object name.</li>
        <li>Use colon plus one space between each property and its value.</li>
        <li>Use quotes around string values, not around numeric values.</li>
        <li>Do not add a comma after the last property-value pair.</li>
        <li>Place the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.</li>
        <li>Always end  an object definition with a semicolon.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h3 id="click6">Line Length</h3>
<p>
    For readability, avoid lines longer than 80 characters.<br/>
    If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator or a comma.
</p>



<h3 id="click7">Naming Conventions:</h3>
<p>
    Always use the same naming convention for all your code.
</p>


<h3 id="click8">Loading JS:</h3>
<p>
    Use simple syntax for loading external scripts (the type attribute is not necessary):
</p>


<h3 id="click9">Accessing HTML:</h3>
<p>
    A consequence of using "untidy" HTML styles, might result in JavaScript errors.<br/>
    If possible, use the same naming convention (as JavaScript) in HTML.
</p>



<h3 id="click10">File Extensions:</h3>
<p>
    HTML files should have a .html extension (not <br/>
    CSS files should have a .css extension.<br/>
    JavaScript files should have a .js extension.
</p>


<h3 id="click11">File Names:</h3>
<p>
    Most web servers (Apache, Unix) are case sensitive about file names:<br/>
    london.jpg cannot be accessed as London.jpg.<br/>
    Other web servers (Microsoft, IIS) are not case sensitive:<br/>
    london.jpg can be accessed as London.jpg or london.jpg.<br/>
    If you use a mix of upper and lower case, you have to be extremely consistent.<br/>
    If you move from a case insensitive, to a case sensitive server, even small errors can break your web site.<br/>
    To avoid these problems, always use lower case file names (if possible).
</p>


<h3 id="click12">Performance:</h3>
<p>
    Coding conventions are not used by computers. Most rules have little impact on the execution of programs.<br/>
    Indentation and extra spaces are not significant in small scripts.<br/>
    For code in development, readability should be preferred. Larger production scripts should be minified.
